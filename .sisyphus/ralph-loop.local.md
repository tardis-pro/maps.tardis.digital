also have https://github.com/nektos/act this integrated, run these locally make sure all the pr/branches taht are on, go through github-workflows locally, if its postgis use postgis, make sure you cache dependencies, worktrees , no lazy fixes like removing code or test, i need code cov, lint , tests to pass and verified, do parallely. push changes once done, also make sure all github pr comments are addressed even if they are by a bot.
