start parallel agents, https://github.com/tardis-pro/maps.tardis.digital/issues/ , go through each issue one by one, and create pull request for those. use github mcp to get issues, also before starting on a issue make sure you do the best according to the infra, not the lazy optimal solution, but the absolute best. use all your agents , make sure you check what branches are already worked upon, make sure you fetch the issues everytime before the task is being started, also use oracle and hephaestus to review and plan efficiently. dont stop untill i see all the issues having corresponding prs, you should use github mcp in OC_GITHUB_PAT, also always start your work from main branch, dont cascade branches, before starting verify you can create prs, comment on issues, also check if there are local/remote prs without corresponding pr,
